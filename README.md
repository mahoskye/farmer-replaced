# The Farmer Was Replaced

These are my solutions to the game The Farmer Was Replaced. I have not yet completed the game, but I have made significant progress and have unlocked everything other than the leader board.

## Future Work

Some work remains to optimize crop placement to take advantage of the polyculture feature. And the dinosaurs feature remains to be explored. However, I'm not sure if I'll continue to work on the objectives in this game. I sort of feel like I've gotten what I wanted out of it.
